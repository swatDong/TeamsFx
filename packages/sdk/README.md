# TeamsFx SDK for TypeScript/JavaScript

TeamsFx aims to reduce the developer tasks of implementing identity and access to cloud resources down to single-line statements with "zero configuration".

Use the library to:

- Access core functionalities in client and server environment in a similar way.
- Write user authentication code in a simplified way.

## Getting started

TeamsFx SDK is pre-configured in scaffolded project using TeamsFx toolkit or cli.
Please check the [README](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/packages/vscode-extension/README.md) to see how to create a Teams App project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 10.x.x or higher
- A project created by TeamsFx toolkit VS Code extension or Cli tool.
- If your project has installed `botbuilder` related [packages](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js#packages) as dependencies, ensure they are of the same version and the version `>= 4.9.3`. ([Issue - all of the BOTBUILDER packages should be the same version](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/botbuilder-community-js/issues/57#issuecomment-508538548))

### Install the `@microsoft/teamsfx` package

Install the TeamsFx SDK for TypeScript/JavaScript with `npm`:

```bash
npm install @microsoft/teamsfx
```

### Create and authenticate a `MicrosoftGraphClient`

To create a graph client object to access the Microsoft Graph API, you will need the credential to do authentication. The SDK provides several credential classes to choose that meets various requirements.

Please note that you need to load configuration before using any credentials.

- In browser environment, you need to explicitly pass in the config parameters. The scaffolded React project has provided environment variables to use.

```ts
loadConfiguration({
  authentication: {
    initiateLoginEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_START_LOGIN_PAGE_URL,
    simpleAuthEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMSFX_ENDPOINT,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  },
});
```

- In NodeJS environment like Azure Function, you can just call `loadConfiguration`. It will load from environment variables by default.

```ts
loadConfiguration();
```

#### Using Teams App User Credential

Use the snippet below:

**Note:** You can only use this credential class in browser application like Teams Tab App.

```ts
loadConfiguration({
  authentication: {
    initiateLoginEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_START_LOGIN_PAGE_URL,
    simpleAuthEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMSFX_ENDPOINT,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  },
});
const credential = new TeamsUserCredential();
const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(credential, ["User.Read"]); // Initializes MS Graph SDK using our MsGraphAuthProvider
const profile = await graphClient.api("/me").get();
```

#### Using Microsoft 365 Tenant Credential

It doesn't require the interaction with Teams App user. You can call Microsoft Graph as application.
Use the snippet below:

```ts
loadConfiguration();
const credential = new M365TenantCredential();
const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(credential);
const profile = await graphClient.api("/users/{object_id_of_another_people}").get();
```

## Core Concepts & Code Structure

### Credential

There are 3 credential classes that are used to help simplifying authentication. They are located under [credential](src/credential) folder.
Credential classes implements `TokenCredential` interface that is broadly used in Azure library APIs. They are designed to provide access token for specific scopes.
The credential classes represents different identity under certain scenarios.

`TeamsUserCredential` represents Teams current user's identity. Using this credential will request user consent at the first time.
`M365TenantCredential` represents Microsoft 365 tenant identity. It is usually used when user is not involved like time-triggered automation job.
`OnBehalfOfUserCredential` uses on-behalf-of flow. It needs an access token and you can get a new token for different scope. It's designed to be used in Azure Function or Bot scenarios.

### Bot

Bot related classes are stored under [bot](src/bot) folder.

`TeamsBotSsoPrompt` has a good integration with Bot framework. It simplifies the authentication process when you develops bot application.

### Helper Function

TeamsFx SDK provides helper functions to ease the configuration for third-party libraries. They are located under [core](src/core) folder.

### Error Handling

API will throw `ErrorWithCode` if error happens. Each `ErrorWithCode` contains error code and error message.

For example, to filter out specific error, you could use the following check:

```ts
try {
  const credential = new TeamsUserCredential();
  await credential.login("User.Read");
} catch (err: unknown) {
  if (err instanceof ErrorWithCode && err.code !== ErrorCode.ConsentFailed) {
    throw err;
  } else {
    // Silently fail because user cancels the consent dialog
    return;
  }
}
```

And if credential instance is used in other library like Microsoft Graph, it's possible that error is catched and transformed.

```ts
try {
  const credential = new TeamsUserCredential();
  const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(credential, ["User.Read"]); // Initializes MS Graph SDK using our MsGraphAuthProvider
  const profile = await graphClient.api("/me").get();
} catch (err: unknown) {
  // ErrorWithCode is handled by Graph client
  if (err instanceof GraphError && err.code?.includes(ErrorCode.UiRequiredError)) {
    this.setState({
      showLoginBtn: true,
    });
  }
}
```

## Examples

The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common scenarios, including:

- [Use Graph API in tab app](#use-graph-api-in-tab-app)
- [Call Azure Function in tab app](#call-azure-function-in-tab-app)
- [Access SQL database in Azure Function](#access-sql-database-in-azure-function)
- [Use certificate-based authentication in Azure Function](#use-certificate-based-authentication-in-azure-function)
- [Use Graph API in Bot application](#use-graph-api-in-bot-application)

### Use Graph API in tab app

Use `TeamsUserCredential` and `createMicrosoftGraphClient`.

```ts
loadConfiguration({
  authentication: {
    initiateLoginEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_START_LOGIN_PAGE_URL,
    simpleAuthEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMSFX_ENDPOINT,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  },
});
const credential: any = new TeamsUserCredential();
const graphClient = createMicrosoftGraphClient(credential, ["User.Read"]);
const profile = await graphClient.api("/me").get();
```

### Call Azure Function in tab app

Use `axios` library to make HTTP request to Azure Function.

```ts
loadConfiguration({
  authentication: {
    initiateLoginEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_START_LOGIN_PAGE_URL,
    simpleAuthEndpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_TEAMSFX_ENDPOINT,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID,
  },
});
const credential: any = new TeamsUserCredential();
const token = credential.getToken(""); // Get SSO token for the user
// Call API hosted in Azure Functions on behalf of user
const apiConfig = getResourceConfiguration(ResourceType.API);
const response = await axios.default.get(apiConfig.endpoint + "api/httptrigger1", {
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer " + token,
  },
});
```

### Access SQL database in Azure Function

Use `tedious` library to access SQL and leverage `DefaultTediousConnectionConfiguration` that manages authentication.
Apart from `tedious`, you can also compose connection config of other SQL libraries based on the result of `sqlConnectionConfig.getConfig()`.

```ts
loadConfiguration();
const sqlConnectConfig = new DefaultTediousConnectionConfiguration();
const config = await sqlConnectConfig.getConfig();
const connection = new Connection(config);
connection.on("connect", (error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});
```

### Use certificate-based authentication in Azure Function

```ts
loadConfiguration({
  authentication: {
    clientId: process.env.M365_CLIENT_ID,
    certificateContent: "The content of a PEM-encoded public/private key certificate",
    authorityHost: process.env.M365_AUTHORITY_HOST,
    tenantId: process.env.M365_TENANT_ID,
  },
});
```

### Use Graph API in Bot application

Add `TeamsBotSsoPrompt` to dialog set.

```ts
const { ConversationState, MemoryStorage } = require("botbuilder");
const { DialogSet, WaterfallDialog } = require("botbuilder-dialogs");
const { TeamsBotSsoPrompt } = require("@microsoft/teamsfx");

const convoState = new ConversationState(new MemoryStorage());
const dialogState = convoState.createProperty("dialogState");
const dialogs = new DialogSet(dialogState);

loadConfiguration();
dialogs.add(
  new TeamsBotSsoPrompt("TeamsBotSsoPrompt", {
    scopes: ["User.Read"],
  })
);

dialogs.add(
  new WaterfallDialog("taskNeedingLogin", [
    async (step) => {
      return await step.beginDialog("TeamsBotSsoPrompt");
    },
    async (step) => {
      const token = step.result;
      if (token) {
        // ... continue with task needing access token ...
      } else {
        await step.context.sendActivity(`Sorry... We couldn't log you in. Try again later.`);
        return await step.endDialog();
      }
    },
  ])
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Configure log

You can set custome log level and redirect outputs when using this library.
Logging is turned off by default, you can turn it on by setting log level.

#### Enable log by setting log level

When log level is set, logging is enabled. It prints log information to console by default.

Set log level using the snippet below:

```ts
// Only need the warning and error messages.
setLogLevel(LogLevel.Warn);
```

You can redirect log output by setting custom logger or log function.

##### Redirect by setting custom logger

```ts
setLogLevel(LogLevel.Info);
// Set another logger if you want to redirect to Application Insights in Azure Function
setLogger(context.log);
```

##### Redirect by setting custom log function

Please note that log function will not take effect if you set a custom logger.

```ts
setLogLevel(LogLevel.Info);
// Only log error message to Application Insights in bot application.
setLogFunction((level: LogLevel, message: string) => {
  if (level === LogLevel.Error) {
    this.telemetryClient.trackTrace({
      message: message,
      severityLevel: Severity.Error,
    });
  }
});
```
